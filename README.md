# Indicators Configuration

## Single Indicators

Single indicators are used to display the state of a single entity, such as a sensor or binary sensor, on the card's header. These indicators are ideal for showcasing key information like vehicle battery level, engine status, or lock state. Each single indicator displays the current state of the entity with an optional icon for better visualization.

For example, a single indicator can be used to show whether a car door is locked or unlocked, or to display the remaining battery percentage of the vehicle.

## Group Indicators

Group indicators allow you toThis is useful when you want to track the status of related entities together, such as all door locks or all tire pressures. Group indicators display a summary view of the entities they contain, giving you a quick snapshot of their states.

For instance, you could create a group indicator to monitor the lock status of all car doors, or to show the pressure levels of all tires at once. Group indicators help to keep the interface cleaner and more organized by bundling similar entities together.

# Range Info Bars

Range info bars are used to display progress bars for entities that represent a measurable range, such as fuel levels, battery charge, or remaining range. These bars provide a visual representation of how much of a resource is left, making it easy to monitor critical vehicle metrics at a glance.

### Key Features of Range Info Bars

- **Energy Level**: Track the remaining battery or fuel levels of the vehicle. This can represent the percentage or the exact value, such as kilometers or liters remaining.
- **Range Level**: Visualize how far the vehicle can travel with the remaining energy or fuel. This is particularly useful for electric vehicles or vehicles with long-range capabilities.
- **Progress Color**: Customize the color of the progress bar to better indicate the status (e.g., green for sufficient range, red for low range).

Range info bars help users keep track of their vehicleâ€™s vital statistics in an intuitive and easy-to-read format, ensuring they always know when they need to refuel or recharge.

- **Speed**: How fast the transition between images happens (in milliseconds).
- **Effect**: Choose between different transition effects for the slideshow:
  - `slide`: A classic sliding effect.
  - `fade`: A smooth fade between images.
  - `coverflow`: A 3D coverflow effect that adds depth to the transition.

# Mini map

The mini map feature displays a real-time map within the card, tracking the location of a `device_tracker` entity. This is especially useful for monitoring the current location of your vehicle or other trackable devices.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Display the live location of your vehicle using any `device_tracker` entity.
- **Custom Zoom Level**: Adjust the default zoom level to focus on the area around the tracked device.
